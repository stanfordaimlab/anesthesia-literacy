                            Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery. 
 
What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block?""
 A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room. 
 
What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1.  Faster recovery from anesthesia
2.  Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3.  Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4.  About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5.  Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump."" 
 
What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
 
1.   Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours. 
 
2.  Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump.  The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out. 
 
What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason.  To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient. 
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you. 
 
What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time
 
What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery. 
 
 
Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions. 
 
If you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

If you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",9.7,54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,9th and 10th grade,94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,Cannot compute,0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432,0,0,Procedure Date: 01/14/24,0,0,"More than one sentence found: - You may drink clear liquids such as tea, black coffee (no cream), water, cranberry juice, apple juice, or sports drinks.  - On the day of the procedure/surgery, take your morning medications as instructed with sips of water.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.
2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.
2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.
2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.
2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.
2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block?""
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.
2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.
2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.

What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a ""nerve block""?
A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely ""block"" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.

What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1. Faster recovery from anesthesia
2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a ""nerve block pump.""

What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.

1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or ""block"" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.

2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.

What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.

What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.

What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.

Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.

**Benefits of a Nerve Block:**

**Types of Nerve Blocks:**

1. A single shot that lasts 3-24 hours.
2. A pump that gives medicine for up to 3-4 days.

**Risks of Nerve Blocks:**
There are some risks, like infection, bleeding, tissue damage, or the medicine not working. The doctor will use special tools to lower these risks.

Address: 500 Pasteur Dr, Stanford
How to Get There: Use Elevator M (numbers 5, 6, 7, or 8) on the right side when you enter the main lobby.

Eating and Drinking Before Surgery:

1. Follow the eating and drinking rules your doctor gave you.

2. If your doctor didn't give you rules, here's what to do:
   - Don't eat any food, candy, or chew gum after midnight the night before your surgery.
   - Don't drink milk, soy, or protein shakes after midnight the night before your surgery.
   - You can drink clear liquids like tea without milk, black coffee, water, cranberry juice, apple juice, or sports drinks. Nothing with bits in it.

Getting Home:

What to Bring and Wear:

Medicines Before Surgery:

- Stop taking herbal supplements and fish oils 1 week before your surgery.

- If you take blood thinners like coumadin, Lovenox, Plavix, Eliquis, Pradaxa, Xarelto, Brilinta, or others, talk to your doctor about what to do.

About Your Anesthesia:

You might get a ""nerve block"" to help with pain during and after surgery. This is when a doctor gives you medicine to numb the area where you'll have surgery. You might stay awake or be given medicine to make you sleepy during the operation.

Benefits of a Nerve Block:
- You might wake up faster after surgery.
- It can control pain better than just taking pain pills.
- You might not need as many pain pills, which means fewer side effects like sleepiness, upset stomach, constipation, and itching.
- The numb feeling can last from 3 to 24 hours.
- If you have a ""nerve block pump,"" it can last 3-4 days.

Types of Nerve Blocks:
- A single shot that numbs the area for 3 to 24 hours.
- A pump that gives you medicine for a few days.

Risks of Nerve Blocks:
Like any medical procedure, there are risks like infection, bleeding, damage to tissues, reaction to the medicine, or the block might not work. The doctor will use special equipment to lower these risks.

You'll talk to the anesthesia team on the morning of your surgery to ask questions and make a plan.

When to Arrive for Surgery:
Please come in 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery time.

When Will They Call Me?
They'll call you by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday evening if your surgery is on Monday.

Will I Need More Pain Medicine?
Yes, you might need more pain medicine that you take by mouth. They'll give you instructions when you leave the hospital.

About Your Anesthesia:

You might get a ""nerve block"" for your surgery. This is a shot that numbs the area and helps with pain. You might stay awake, get sleepy medicine, or be asleep during surgery.

Benefits of a nerve block:
- You might wake up faster after surgery.
- It can control pain better than some pain medicines.
- You might not need as many pain medicines, which means fewer side effects like sleepiness, upset stomach, constipation, and itching.
- The numb feeling can last 3 to 24 hours.
- With a ""nerve block pump,"" it can last 3 to 4 days.

What kind of nerve block will I get?
Your doctor will talk to you about your choices on the day of your surgery.

Risks of a nerve block:
All medical treatments have risks. With a nerve block, you might get an infection, bleed, or have damage to tissues. You might have a reaction to the medicine, or it might not work. The doctor will use special tools and clean methods to lower these risks.

When to Arrive for Surgery:
Please come 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery.

When Will They Call Me?
They'll call you by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday evening if your surgery is on Monday.

Will I need more pain medicine?
Yes, you might need more pain medicine that you take by mouth. They'll give you instructions when you leave.

Where to Go:
New Stanford Hospital (500P), 2nd floor, Pre-Procedure Unit.
How to Get There: Take Elevator M (numbers 5, 6, 7, or 8) on the right side when you enter the main lobby.

What You Can Eat and Drink:

1. Do what your doctor told you about eating and drinking before your surgery.
2. If your doctor didn't tell you what to do, here's what you should do:
   - Don't eat any food, candy, or chew gum after midnight the night before your surgery.
   - Don't drink milk, soy, or protein shakes after midnight the night before your surgery.

Getting Home:
You need someone over 18 to drive you home after surgery. You can't use a taxi or rideshare unless you have an adult with you. We're not doing valet parking because of COVID-19.

What to Bring and Wear:
Wear comfy clothes. Leave valuable things at home. Don't wear makeup, jewelry, metal piercings, or contact lenses. Bring your ID, insurance card, and you might need to pay a co-payment or deductible.

Medicine Before Surgery:
- Stop taking herbal supplements and fish oils 1 week before your surgery.

- If you take blood thinners like coumadin, Lovenox, Plavix, Eliquis, Pradaxa, Xarelto, Brilinta, or others, talk to your doctor for instructions.

About Your Anesthesia:
You might get a ""nerve block"" to help with pain during and after surgery. A doctor will give you medicine to numb the area. You might stay awake or sleep during surgery.

Benefits of a Nerve Block:
- You wake up faster after surgery.
- It controls pain better than just using pain pills.
- You might not need as many pain pills, so you'll have fewer side effects like sleepiness, upset stomach, constipation, and itching.
- Pain relief can last 3-24 hours or even 3-4 days with a special pump.

Types of Nerve Blocks:
- Single injection: One shot of medicine to numb the area for 3-24 hours.
- Nerve block pump: A tiny tube stays on your skin to give medicine for 3-4 days.

Risks of Nerve Blocks:
All medical treatments have risks. These can include infection, bleeding, damage to tissues, reaction to the medicine, or the block might not work. The doctor will use special tools to lower these risks.

You'll talk to the anesthesia team on the day of your surgery to decide what's best for you.

When to Arrive for Surgery:
Please come 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery time.

When Will They Call Me?
They'll call you by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday evening if your surgery is on Monday.

Will I Need More Pain Medicine?
Yes, your doctor might give you more pain pills. You'll get instructions when you leave the hospital.

Other Important Info:
Your Anesthesia Plan
Depending on your surgery, you might get a special kind of pain medicine called regional anesthesia or a ""nerve block.""

What's a ""nerve block""?
It's a shot that numbs part of your body to help with pain during and after surgery. A special doctor gives you this shot.

Why is a nerve block good?
- You might wake up faster after surgery.
- It can control pain better than some other pain medicines.
- You might not need as many pain pills, so you'll have fewer side effects like sleepiness, upset stomach, constipation, and itching.
- The numb feeling can last 3-24 hours or even 3-4 days with a special pump.

What kind of nerve block will I get?
Your doctor will talk to you about the best choice on your surgery day.

Are there risks with a nerve block?
Yes, like with any medical thing, there can be risks like infection, bleeding, or damage to tissues. The doctor will use special tools to keep risks low.

When should I come in for surgery?
Please arrive 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery.

When will they call me with my surgery time?
They'll call you by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday evening if your surgery is on Monday.

Will I need more pain medicine with a nerve block?
Yes, your doctor might give you more pain medicine to take by mouth. You'll get instructions when you leave the hospital.
