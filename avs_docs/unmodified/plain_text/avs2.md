                            Regional Block After Visit Summary
The plan for your anesthesia may depend on the type of surgery you may be having. You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery. 
 
What is Regional Anesthesia, also called a "nerve block?"
 A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely "block" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room. 
 
What are the benefits of having a Regional block?
1.  Faster recovery from anesthesia
2.  Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone
3.  Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching
4.  About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication
5.  Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a "nerve block pump." 
 
What type of nerve block will I receive?
Depending on your health, type of surgery and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.
 
1.   Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or "block" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours. 
 
2.  Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump.  The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out. 
 
What are the risks of regional anesthesia?
Like any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason.  To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient. 
On the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you. 
 
What time am I expected to come in for surgery?
You will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time
 
What time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?
The Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery. 
 
 
Will I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?
Yes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.
