You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery. \n \nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block?\"\n A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room. \n \nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1.  Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2.  Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3.  Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4.  About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5.  Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\" \n \nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n \n1.   Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours. \n \n2.  Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump.  The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out. \n \nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason.  To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient. \nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you. \n \nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time\n \nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery. \n \n \nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions. \n \nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332. \n",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block?\"\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\n\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \"nerve block\"?\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \"block\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \"nerve block pump.\"\n\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\n\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \"block\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\n\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\n\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\n\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 ½ hours before surgery time.\n\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\n\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\n\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold/flu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.",

It helps with pain and can mean you might not need as much medicine. You might get a single shot or a pump that gives medicine for a few days. There are some risks, but we use special tools to keep it safe. You'll learn more on the day of surgery.\n\n**Surgery Day:**\nCome in 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery.\n\n**When Will They Call Me?**\nThey'll call by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday if your surgery is on Monday.\n\n**Will I Need More Pain Medicine?**\nYes, you might get more pain medicine to take by mouth.

You might stay awake or be given medicine to make you sleepy during the operation.\n\nBenefits of a Nerve Block:\n- You might wake up faster after surgery.\n- It can control pain better than just taking pain pills.\n- You might not need as many pain pills, which means fewer side effects like sleepiness, upset stomach, constipation, and itching.\n- The numb feeling can last from 3 to 24 hours.\n- If you have a \"nerve block pump,\" it can last 3-4 days.\n\nTypes of Nerve Blocks:\n- A single shot that numbs the area for 3 to 24 hours.\n- A pump that gives you medicine for a few days.\n\nRisks of Nerve Blocks:\nLike any medical procedure, there are risks like infection, bleeding, damage to tissues, reaction to the medicine, or the block might not work. The doctor will use special equipment to lower these risks.\n\nYou'll talk to the anesthesia team on the morning of your surgery to ask questions and make a plan.\n\nWhen to Arrive for Surgery:\nPlease come in 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery time.\n\nWhen Will They Call Me?\nThey'll call you by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday evening if your surgery is on Monday.\n\nWill I Need More Pain Medicine?\nYes, you might need more pain medicine that you take by mouth. They'll give you instructions when you leave the hospital.\n\nIf you get sick, like with a cold or flu, or if you've been around someone with COVID-19, or if you feel worse or have been in the hospital recently, please call us at 650-498-5332.",

The numb feeling can last from 3 hours to 4 days.\n- Types of nerve blocks: A single shot that lasts a short time, or a pump that gives medicine for a few days.\n- Risks: Like all treatments, there are some risks, like infection or not working well. We use special tools to keep risks low.\n- You'll talk to the anesthesia team on the day of your surgery to decide what's best for you.\n\nWhen to Arrive:\n- Come in 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery time.\n\nPain Medicine:\n- You might need more pain medicine after the nerve block.

With a nerve block, you might get an infection, bleed, or have damage to tissues. You might have a reaction to the medicine, or it might not work. The doctor will use special tools and clean methods to lower these risks.\n\nWhen to Arrive for Surgery:\nPlease come 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery.\n\nWhen Will They Call Me?\nThey'll call you by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday evening if your surgery is on Monday.\n\nWill I need more pain medicine?\nYes, you might need more pain medicine that you take by mouth.

These can include infection, bleeding, damage to tissues, reaction to the medicine, or the block might not work. The doctor will use special tools to lower these risks.\n\nYou'll talk to the anesthesia team on the day of your surgery to decide what's best for you.\n\nWhen to Arrive for Surgery:\nPlease come 2 to 2 and a half hours before your surgery time.\n\nWhen Will They Call Me?\nThey'll call you by 6 PM the night before your surgery or on Friday evening if your surgery is on Monday.\n\nWill I Need More Pain Medicine?\nYes, your doctor might give you more pain pills.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery. \\n \\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block?\\\"\\n A nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room. \\n \\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1.  Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2.  Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3.  Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4.  About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5.  Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\" \\n \\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n \\n1.   Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours. \\n \\n2.  Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump.  The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out. \\n \\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason.  To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient. \\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you. \\n \\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time\\n \\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery. \\n \\n \\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions. \\n \\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332. \\n\",54.22,12.7,11.89,12.1,8.15,160,12.6,9.92,\"9th and 10th grade\",93.5,92.35,39.98,3.1,53.6,49.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,\"Cannot compute\",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],[4,4,\"unmodified\",0,null,\"Department: ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\t\\t\\nPreoperative Instructions\\t \\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.78,39.93,3.0,53.9,49.29,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4300000000000068,-0.04999999999999716,-0.1000000000000001,0.2999999999999972,-0.09000000000000341],[9,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",4,\"2024-01-23-T-04-54-08\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[14,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",104,\"2024-01-23-T-04-58-41\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.78,39.93,3.0,53.9,49.29,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4300000000000068,-0.04999999999999716,-0.1000000000000001,0.2999999999999972,-0.09000000000000341],[19,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",204,\"2024-01-23-T-05-03-13\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.51,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.1299999999999955],[24,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",304,\"2024-01-23-T-05-07-56\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nDepartment Phone: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[29,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",404,\"2024-01-23-T-05-12-33\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,12.0,8.15,161,10.5,9.74,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.78,39.86,3.0,53.8,49.11,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.09999999999999964,0.0,1,-2.1,-0.1799999999999997,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4300000000000068,-0.1199999999999974,-0.1000000000000001,0.1999999999999957,-0.2700000000000031],[34,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",504,\"2024-01-23-T-05-17-11\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\n\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.8,8.13,159,12.4,9.66,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,93.0,40.04,3.0,54.1,49.67,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.2999999999999989,-0.01999999999999957,-1,-0.1999999999999993,-0.2599999999999998,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.6500000000000057,0.06000000000000227,-0.1000000000000001,0.5,0.2899999999999991],[39,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",604,\"2024-01-23-T-05-21-51\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nPhone: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.51,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.1299999999999955],[44,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",704,\"2024-01-23-T-05-26-33\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.13,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.88,39.98,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.01999999999999957,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5300000000000011,0.0,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[49,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",804,\"2024-01-23-T-05-31-09\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[54,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",904,\"2024-01-23-T-05-35-45\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[59,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1004,\"2024-01-23-T-05-40-20\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[64,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1104,\"2024-01-23-T-05-45-00\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[69,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1204,\"2024-01-23-T-05-49-45\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nContact: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.51,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.1299999999999955],[74,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1304,\"2024-01-23-T-05-54-26\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,12.0,8.15,161,10.5,9.74,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.78,39.86,3.0,53.8,49.11,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.09999999999999964,0.0,1,-2.1,-0.1799999999999997,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4300000000000068,-0.1199999999999974,-0.1000000000000001,0.1999999999999957,-0.2700000000000031],[79,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1404,\"2024-01-23-T-05-59-07\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block?\\\"\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,11.9,8.13,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.76,39.93,3.0,54.0,49.3,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.1999999999999993,-0.01999999999999957,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4100000000000108,-0.04999999999999716,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,-0.0800000000000054],[84,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1504,\"2024-01-23-T-06-03-37\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nContact: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.63,12.6,12.0,12.0,8.15,160,12.6,9.78,\"9th and 10th grade\",93.91,92.63,39.9,3.0,53.7,49.17,-0.09999999999999964,0.4100000000000037,-0.09999999999999964,0.1099999999999994,-0.09999999999999964,0.0,0,0.0,-0.1400000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.4099999999999966,0.2800000000000011,-0.0799999999999983,-0.1000000000000001,0.1000000000000014,-0.2100000000000009],[89,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1604,\"2024-01-23-T-06-08-29\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia.\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone.\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching.\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication.\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,12.0,8.15,161,10.5,9.74,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.78,39.86,3.0,53.8,49.08,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.09999999999999964,0.0,1,-2.1,-0.1799999999999997,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4300000000000068,-0.1199999999999974,-0.1000000000000001,0.1999999999999957,-0.3000000000000043],[94,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1704,\"2024-01-23-T-06-13-09\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nContact: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.51,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.1299999999999955],[99,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1804,\"2024-01-23-T-06-17-44\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nContact: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 PM the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us at 650-498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,12.0,8.15,161,10.5,9.74,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.78,39.87,3.0,53.8,49.11,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.09999999999999964,0.0,1,-2.1,-0.1799999999999997,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4300000000000068,-0.1099999999999994,-0.1000000000000001,0.1999999999999957,-0.2700000000000031],[104,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",1904,\"2024-01-23-T-06-22-22\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.43,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.04999999999999716],[109,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",2004,\"2024-01-23-T-06-26-59\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nContact: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[114,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",2104,\"2024-01-23-T-06-31-33\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[119,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",2204,\"2024-01-23-T-06-36-06\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nContact: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.06,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.78,39.93,3.0,53.9,49.29,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1699999999999999,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.4300000000000068,-0.04999999999999716,-0.1000000000000001,0.2999999999999972,-0.09000000000000341],[124,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",2304,\"2024-01-23-T-06-40-33\",\"Department: Anesthesia Preoperative Program\\nDept Phone: 650-555-5555\\nPreoperative Instructions\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: Your procedure time and location have not been confirmed.

You may require regional anesthesia for your upcoming surgery.\\n\\nWhat is Regional Anesthesia, also called a \\\"nerve block\\\"?\\nA nerve block is an injection of local anesthetic, or numbing medication, administered in a muscle that is near or around a specific nerve or group of nerves. This will help decrease or completely \\\"block\\\" sensation to the area to better control your pain during and after surgery. This procedure is done by an anesthesiologist who is specially trained for Regional Anesthesia. With a nerve block, you may remain awake, receive IV sedation, or general anesthesia in the operating room.\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of having a Regional block?\\n1. Faster recovery from anesthesia\\n2. Better pain control than opioid (narcotic) pain medications alone\\n3. Decreased need for opioid pain medications, and therefore fewer side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching\\n4. About 3-24 hours of pain relief after a single injection of numbing medication\\n5. Up to 3-4 days of pain relief with a local infusion also called, a \\\"nerve block pump.\\\"\\n\\nWhat type of nerve block will I receive?\\nDepending on your health, type of surgery, and your preference, your Regional Anesthesiologist will discuss your options on the day of your surgery.\\n\\n1. Single injection nerve block is a one-time injection of local anesthetic that will numb, or \\\"block\\\" sensation around the nerve. The duration of the block depends on the medication used and the effects can last between 3 to 24 hours.\\n\\n2. Nerve block pump is a continuous delivery of local anesthetic given through an indwelling catheter. The catheter is the size of a guitar string and it is securely taped to your skin. Should you need additional numbing medication, you can administer a bolus by pressing a button on the pump. The nerve pump can be kept for 3-4 days or until the local anesthesia medicine runs out.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of regional anesthesia?\\nLike any other medical procedure, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia. Complications or side effects can occur and can include infection, bleeding, damage to surrounding tissues including blood vessels or muscle tissue, reaction to the medication, failure of the numbing medicine to have an effect, or stopping the procedure for any reason. To minimize many of these risks, the regional anesthesiologist uses an ultrasound machine to guide the placement of the block. It is done using a sterile technique to minimize the risk of infection. The specific risks may vary with the procedure and the medical condition of the patient.\\nOn the morning of your surgery, you will meet members from the Regional Anesthesia team to answer any additional questions and discuss a plan that works best for you.\\n\\nWhat time am I expected to come in for surgery?\\nYou will be requested to come 2-2 \\u00bd hours before surgery time.\\n\\nWhat time will the Preop Area call me to give me the time to come in for surgery?\\nThe Preop Area will call you by 6 pm the night before surgery or Friday evening before Monday's surgery.\\n\\nWill I need additional pain medication with a nerve block?\\nYes. Your surgeon may prescribe additional pain medications by mouth. Upon discharge, you will be provided with instructions.\\n\\nIf you experience any new developments in your health such as cold\\u002fflu, possible symptoms or exposure to COVID-19, worsening of an existing health condition, recent hospitalizations, or any new concerning symptoms following your anesthesia preoperative visit, please call us (650) 498-5332.\",54.83,12.5,12.0,11.9,8.14,160,12.6,9.7,\"9th and 10th grade\",94.11,92.9,39.99,3.0,54.0,49.48,-0.2000000000000011,0.6099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,0.1099999999999994,-0.1999999999999993,-0.009999999999999787,0,0.0,-0.2200000000000006,\"Cannot compute\",0.6099999999999994,0.5500000000000114,0.01000000000000512,-0.1000000000000001,0.3999999999999986,0.09999999999999432],[129,4,\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",2404,\"2024-01-23-T-06-45-00\",\"ANESTHESIA PREOPERATIVE PROGRAM\\nContact: 650-555-5555\\n\\nPreoperative Instructions\\n\\nProcedure Date: 01\\u002f14\\u002f24\\nProcedure Location: YOUR PROCEDURE TIME AND LOCATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.
